# RTMP

The RTMP package (and it's subordinate packages) are dual licensed with both Apache2 and MIT licenses. 

This code is a working fork of [github.com/gwuhaolin/livego](https://github.com/gwuhaolin/livego) and as part of the original MIT license we are distributing this license.


### Refactoring 

I am currently refactoring a lot of this library to make it more extensible.

I plan on adding unit tests, and adding some better idomatic Go practices.

I have no longterm plans for this, and will maintain the original license and host the source code here.
