`twinx` is a live-streaming command line tool for Linux. 
It connects streaming services (like Twitch, OBS and YouTube) together via a common `title` and `description`.

### Overview

Use `twinx` to manage your streams.
This should be the first and last tool you use while live-streaming.
This will kick off a persistent standalone linux process that runs as a temporary daemon for the duration of the stream.
The daemon can then be interfaced with using the `twinx` command line tool.
You can add integrations and functionality to your stream after it has been started.

## Example

Use `twinx` to start a new stream on a Linux filesystem.
This will register your `title` and `description` for your new stream, and start the background process.
The title and description will be used as we work with various backends.

```bash 
$ # twinx stream start <title> <description>
$ twinx stream start \
    "How to hack the planet" \
    "This is a live stream about how to hack the kernel to burn down capitalism"
```

Start an RTMP server. If no `host:port` is defined, `twinx` will select a port and listen on `localhost:1935`.

```bash 
$ twinx rtmp start <optional host:port>
$ twinx rtmp start localhost:1719
```

Send the local stream to a remote backend such as [Twitch](https://stream.twitch.tv/ingests/) or [YouTube Live](https://youtube.com) via the proxy command.
You may proxy to multiple backends 🙂 at the same time.

```bash 
# Example Twitch
$ twinx rtmp proxy rtmp://jfk.contribute.live-video.net/app/{stream_key}

# Example YouTube
$ twinx rtmp proxy rtmp://a.rtmp.youtube.com/live2/{stream_key}
```

## Configuration

Twitch Callback URL Port: 1717

Environmental Variables

```bash
# OBS
export TWINX_OBS_PORT="1718"
export TWINX_OBS_PASSWORD=""
export TWINX_OBS_HOST="localhost"

# YouTube
export TWINX_YOUTUBE_API_KEY=""
```

## Permissions

`twinx` will manage RTMP servers, unix sockets, and gRPC servers and clients for you.
`twinx` requires root privileges to do this.
